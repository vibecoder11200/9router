# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

9Router (`9router-app`) — a local AI routing gateway + Next.js dashboard. It exposes one OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`/v1/*`) and routes traffic across 40+ upstream providers with format translation, model-combo fallback, multi-account fallback, OAuth/API-key credential management, token refresh, quota/usage tracking, and optional cloud sync.

Two published artifacts live in this one repo:
- The **dashboard + gateway** (root `package.json`, `9router-app`) — the Next.js server that does the actual routing.
- The **CLI launcher** (`cli/`, published to npm as `9router`) — a separate package that installs/starts the server and manages the tray. It has its own `package.json`, version, and build.

The code lives in `src/` (Next.js app + dashboard/compat APIs), `open-sse/` (the provider-agnostic routing/translation engine), `cli/` (the launcher package), and `tests/`.

## Commands

Dashboard/gateway (run from repo root):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
PORT=20128 NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:20128 npm run dev   # dev (webpack, port 20127 by default via next dev)
npm run build && PORT=20128 HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 npm run start           # production
```
- Bun variants: `npm run dev:bun` / `build:bun` / `start:bun`.
- Default runtime port is **20128** (dashboard at `/dashboard`, API at `/v1`).
- Lint: `npx eslint .` (config `eslint.config.mjs`, extends `eslint-config-next`).

CLI package (`cli/`):
```bash
npm run cli:pack       # build + npm pack from root
cd cli && npm run dev  # nodemon watch
```

Tests (vitest, in `tests/`, an **independent** ESM package — not wired into root `npm test`):
```bash
npm install                             # ROOT deps first — tests import from src/ which needs `open`, `undici`, etc.
cd tests && npm install                 # then tests' own deps (vitest) → tests/node_modules (allowed by tests/.gitignore)
npx vitest run                          # all tests; auto-discovers tests/vitest.config.js
npx vitest run unit/capabilities.test.js   # single file (path relative to tests/)
```
> The committed `tests/package.json` `test` script hardcodes Unix paths (`NODE_PATH=/tmp/node_modules …`) — a shared-install workaround from upstream. On Windows (or anywhere), ignore it and use the `npx vitest` form above; `vitest.config.js` resolves the `open-sse`/`@/` aliases from the repo root regardless of where vitest lives.
>
> **The suite is NOT expected to be all-green on a plain checkout.** As of v0.6.33: 2442 tests, ~2339 pass / ~103 fail (network-dependent and environment-dependent files included). Judge regressions by diffing a full JSON run against the pre-change tree (`npx vitest run --reporter=json` in `tests/`) — `verify-no-regression.mjs` assumes Unix `/app/` paths and mis-reports on Windows. Expected red:
> - 54 catalogued in `tests/__baseline__/known-fails.txt` (rtk, oauth-cursor-auto-import, translator-request-normalization, cursor-agent-proto, …).
> - `unit/embeddings.cloud.test.js` imports `cloud/src/handlers/embeddings.js` — the `cloud/` worker dir is **not in this repo**, so it always fails here.
> - `unit/xai-oauth-service.test.js` times out (5s) when the xAI endpoint-discovery fetch isn't reachable/mocked.
> - `real/*.real.test.js` make live provider calls — need credentials, skip otherwise.
- `*.real.test.js` under `tests/translator/real/` make live provider calls — skip unless credentials are set.
- Regression baselines: `tests/__baseline__/verify-*.mjs` compare against committed snapshots (providers, aliases, OAuth URLs). Run these after touching provider registry / alias logic.

## Architecture

Two authoritative docs already exist — read them before working in these areas rather than re-deriving:
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — full system: request lifecycle, combo/account fallback, OAuth + token refresh, cloud sync, data model.
- `open-sse/AGENTS.md` — the routing/translation engine's own conventions and "how to add a provider/executor/translator". **Read this before editing anything under `open-sse/`.**

### Request flow (the thing to understand first)
`src/app/api/v1/*` route (Next rewrite maps `/v1/*` → `/api/v1/*` in `next.config.mjs`)
→ `src/sse/handlers/chat.js` (parse, combo expansion, account-selection loop)
→ `open-sse/handlers/chatCore.js` (detect source format, translate request, dispatch to executor, retry/refresh, stream setup)
→ `open-sse/executors/*` (per-provider upstream call; `default.js` handles any OpenAI-compatible provider)
→ `open-sse/translator/*` (client format ↔ provider format)
→ SSE back to client.

`src/sse/` is the app-side entry glue; `open-sse/` is the provider-agnostic engine (also usable standalone). Cross that boundary consciously.

### Translator engine (`open-sse/translator/`)
- Pivots through **OpenAI as the intermediate format**. A translator registered on an exact `source:target` pair (e.g. `claude:kiro`) runs as a **direct route**, skipping the lossy double-hop. Prefer a direct route for fragile pairs (thinking blocks, tool ids, non-base64 images, `is_error`).
- Translators **self-register** via `register(from, to, reqFn, resFn)` as an import side effect — a new translator file MUST be imported in `open-sse/translator/index.js` or it never runs.
- Never hardcode role/block/model strings — use `open-sse/translator/schema/` and `open-sse/config/` constants. Config-driven and DRY is enforced by convention here.

### Provider registry (`open-sse/providers/registry/*`)
- One file per provider. `providers/registry/index.js` is an **auto-generated** static import list — regenerate it with `scripts/migrate-registry.mjs` / `injectDisplayToRegistry.mjs`, don't hand-edit.
- Add a provider: copy `providers/REGISTRY_TEMPLATE.js`, add models to `config/providerModels.js`. Only add an executor for non-OpenAI-compatible upstreams.

### Persistence — IMPORTANT (ARCHITECTURE.md is stale here)
State is **no longer `db.json`**. It's a SQLite layer under `src/lib/db/` with an adapter fallback chain (`driver.js`): `bun:sqlite` → `better-sqlite3` (optional native dep) → `node:sqlite` (Node ≥22.5) → `sql.js` (pure-JS fallback, always works). `better-sqlite3` is deliberately in `optionalDependencies` so install never fails without build tools.
- `src/lib/localDb.js` is a **backward-compat shim** re-exporting `src/lib/db/index.js`. New code should import from `@/lib/db/index.js`; per-entity logic lives in `src/lib/db/repos/*`. Schema/migrations in `src/lib/db/migrations/`.
- DB file location resolves via `src/lib/db/paths.js` (`DATA_DIR`, else `~/.9router/`).
- Usage/logs (`src/lib/usageDb.js`, `usage.json` + `log.txt`) still live under `~/.9router` and do **not** follow `DATA_DIR`.

### RTK token saver (`open-sse/rtk/`)
Pre-translate hooks that compress `tool_result` content in-place to cut tokens. **Fail-open**: any error returns null and leaves the body untouched — never throw out of them. Skips `is_error`/`status:"error"` results to preserve traces.

## Conventions & gotchas

- Plain JavaScript (ESM), no TypeScript. `@/*` path alias → `src/*` (`jsconfig.json`).
- `custom-server.js` wraps the Next standalone server to derive client IP from the TCP socket and strip attacker-controlled `X-Forwarded-For` — trusting forwarding headers only from a loopback reverse proxy. Preserve this when touching request/IP/rate-limit code.
- Security-sensitive env: `JWT_SECRET` (session cookie), `INITIAL_PASSWORD` (default `123456` — must override), `API_KEY_SECRET`, `MACHINE_ID_SALT`. Full env contract in `.env.example` and ARCHITECTURE.md's env matrix.
- Binary/protobuf upstreams (kiro EventStream, cursor protobuf, commandcode NDJSON) don't round-trip through OpenAI — they're handled inside their own executor, not the translator.
- Versioning: **root `package.json` and `cli/package.json` MUST stay in sync** (see Release SOP below). They are *built* independently but ship at the *same* version. Commit style is Conventional Commits (`fix(translator): …`, `feat(...)`).

## Release SOP (cutting a new version)

This fork ships via **GitHub Releases** (not npm). The CLI launcher (`cli/cli.js`) reads its own version from `cli/package.json` (`pkg.version`) and compares it against the latest GitHub Release tag to decide whether an update is available. **If the two `package.json` versions drift, the update check loops forever** ("Update to vX (current: vY)" with Y < X even after reinstall). This is exactly the v0.5.31→v0.5.32 bug.

### Version files that MUST move together

On every release, bump **both** to the new version, in the same commit:

| File | Purpose | Read by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `package.json` (root, `9router-app`) | Dashboard/gateway package | build, dashboard "about" |
| `cli/package.json` (`9router`) | CLI launcher package | `cli/cli.js` menu, `--version`, update check |

Also add a `# vX.Y.Z (date)` entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md` (move it out of `# Unreleased` if it was staged there).

### The exact release sequence

```bash
# 1. Bump BOTH package.json files + CHANGELOG entry, in ONE commit
#    (e.g. 0.5.32 -> 0.5.33)
git add package.json cli/package.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore(release): vX.Y.Z"

# 2. Tag that commit (annotated, with the v prefix)
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"

# 3. Push both — the tag push triggers .github/workflows/cli-release.yml,
#    which builds the CLI tarball and attaches it to the GitHub Release
git push origin master
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

`cli-release.yml` then builds `9router-<version>.tgz` + the stable alias `9router.tgz` and attaches both to the release. Users upgrade by re-running the install one-liner, which always pulls `releases/latest/download/9router.tgz`.

### Pre-flight checklist before tagging

- [ ] `package.json` version == `cli/package.json` version (run `grep '"version"' package.json cli/package.json` — the two numbers MUST match)
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has a `# vX.Y.Z (date)` entry at the top
- [ ] Tagged commit contains fork-defining files (`open-sse/providers/registry/gemini-web.js`, `…/ds2api.js`) — `cli-release.yml`'s `verify-release-tag` job refuses to build a bare-upstream commit, so don't tag a pre-merge upstream commit
- [ ] Commit message has **no** `#NNNN` / `org/repo#NNNN` cross-reference unless the user explicitly approved it (see "Commit-message cross-references" below)

### If you need to re-release the same version (tarball was wrong)

Don't create a new tag. Force-move the existing tag onto the fixed commit:

```bash
git tag -f -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"   # -f moves the existing tag
git push origin master
git push -f origin vX.Y.Z           # -f overwrites the remote tag, re-triggers the build
```

This re-runs `cli-release.yml` and re-uploads `9router.tgz` (`--clobber`). Existing users on that version see no change; users on an older version get the fixed tarball on next install.

### Commit-message cross-references — ASK before including, never auto-add

GitHub scans **every pushed commit message** for `org/repo#NNNN` / `#NNNN` tokens and auto-posts a permanent timeline event on the referenced PR/issue ("X pushed a commit that referenced this pull request"). Two hard facts learned the hard way (a v0.6.20 release commit whose message cited an upstream PR):

- The event is **not deletable** via UI or API — it is an auto-generated record.
- **Amend / force-push does NOT remove it.** Rewriting history only moves the branch pointer; GitHub keeps the already-logged event *and* keeps the old dangling commit reachable through it (until its own GC, days later). The event text persists even after the commit is gone.

So: **never put a PR/issue/upstream reference in a commit message by default.** Before any commit whose message would mention an external PR/issue/repo, **ask the user first** — "include a reference to #NNNN in the commit message?" — and default to **omitting** it unless they explicitly say yes. If a reference must be recorded, keep it out of the commit message entirely: put it in the PR description or a local note instead. The reference is only safe to mention in *unpushed* local notes, never in a message that will be pushed.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **9router** (18674 symbols, 39736 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "master"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
